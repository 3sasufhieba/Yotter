## Kannada Language: History and Features
 
Kannada is one of the oldest languages of India. The oldest literary works in the Epigraphs reveal that the old Kannada flourished during the Ganga dynasty in the 6th century AD and during the Rashtrakuta dynasty during the 9th century[^3^]. The Kannada language is written using the Kannada script, which evolved from the 5th-century Kadamba script[^2^]. Kannada is attested epigraphically for about one and a half millennia and literary Old Kannada flourished in the 6th-century Ganga dynasty and during the 9th-century Rashtrakuta Dynasty[^2^].
 
Kannada is a Southern Dravidian language and according to Sanford B. Steever, its history can be conventionally divided into three stages: Old Kannada (Haá¸·egannaá¸a) from 450 to 1200 AD, Middle Kannada (Naá¸ugannaá¸a) from 1200 to 1700 and Modern Kannada (Hosagannaá¸a) from 1700 to the present[^2^]. Kannada has a rich and diverse literature that spans various genres such as poetry, drama, fiction, biography, history, and philosophy. Some of the notable writers and poets of Kannada include Pampa, Ranna, Harihara, Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Kumara Vyasa, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa, Sarvajna, Kuvempu, Bendre, Shivaram Karanth, Masti Venkatesha Iyengar, U.R. Ananthamurthy, Girish Karnad, and Chandrashekhara Kambara.
 
Kannada has several dialects and regional variations that reflect the geographical, social, and cultural diversity of Karnataka. The southern variety is associated with the cities of Mysore and Bangalore, the northern with Hubli-Dharwad, and the coastal with Mangalore[^1^]. The prestige varieties are based on the Mysore-Bangalore variety. Social varieties are currently characterized by education and class or caste, resulting in at least three distinct social dialects: Brahman, non-Brahman, and Dalit (formerly untouchable)[^1^]. A diglossia or dichotomy also exists between formal literary varieties and spoken varieties.
 
Kannada has a rich phonetic system with five short and five long vowels, two diphthongs, and 34 consonants. Kannada uses typical Dravidian retroflex consonants (sounds pronounced with the tip of the tongue curled back against the roof of the mouth), such as /á¸/, /á¹/, and /á¹­/, as well as a series of voiced and voiceless aspirates borrowed from the Indo-Aryan language family[^1^]. The word order is subjectâobjectâverb, as in the other Dravidian languages. Verbs are marked for person, number, and gender. The case-marking pattern is nominative-accusative, with experiencer subjects taking the dative inflection. Most inflection is rendered through affixation, especially of suffixes[^1^].
 
Kannada is a highly inflected language with three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter or common) and two numbers (singular and plural). It is also a highly agglutinative language with extensive use of compound words. Kannada has an extensive set of postpositions that indicate various relations between nouns. Kannada also has a complex system of honorifics that express respect or politeness.
